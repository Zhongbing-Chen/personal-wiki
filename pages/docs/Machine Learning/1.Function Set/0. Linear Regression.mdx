> Basic Part for Understanding the Statistics

0. What is the purpose of this tool??
1. Design The Model
2. Design The Loss Function
3. Look up The Best Function
4. Validate By Other Datasets

# What is the purpose of this tool
1. We need a number to tell
2. The range of outcome is hard to iterate by finite elements

# Design the model
Function Pattern: y=$Xw$

where   $X \in R^{n\times m} \quad y \in R^{n\times1} \quad w \in R^{m\times1} \quad b \in R^{n\times1}$

What's m and n?
Write down $y$  and $X$


# Look up The Best Function
[[0. Analytic Solution]]
1. Numerical Way
	[[1. Backpropogation]]
	[[2. Gradient Descent]]

Overfitting Handler
1. Regularization
	- Smooth the function
	- y=$X\beta$+$\alpha$ 
2. Pick a suitable model
